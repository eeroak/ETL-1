## Extract, Transform, Load -project  

### The point of this project is to: 
<br>
Select a dataset, create a data model, load the data in to a relational database, 
<br> 
then extract it to a storage of somekind (in this case probably my local machine), create a dimension model,
<br> 
do an ETL job, load the data into a Data warehouse, and finally fetch it to a dashboard from the warehouse.
<br>
### Technologies used: <br>
